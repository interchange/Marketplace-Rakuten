            isa => Str);

has endpoint => (is => 'ro',
                 default => sub { 'http://webservice.rakuten.de/merchants/' });

has ua => (is => 'lazy');

=head1 METHODS

=head2 api_call($method, $call, $data);

Generic method to do any call. The first argument is the HTTP request
method (get or post). The second argument is the path of the api, e.g.
(C<misc/getKeyInfo>). The third is the structure to send (an hashref).

Return a Marketplace::Rakuten::Response object.

The key is injected into the data hashref in any case.
